## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.



## Conclusions
- The major influencing variables on the house sale price are
    - OverallQual 8,9       
    - OverallCond 9       
    - GrLivArea           
    - Neighborhood (Crawfor,Somerst,NoRidge)
    - Exterior1st (BrkFace)
